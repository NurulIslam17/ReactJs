    question:"What is an event in React?",
    answer:"An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc. 1) React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML. 2) With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML"

    question:"What are the components in React?",
    answer:"Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately. There are two types of react componenets , Functional  and Class Components"
